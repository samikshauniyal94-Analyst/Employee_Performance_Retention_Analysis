# 👨🏻‍💻Employee Performance and Retention Analysis

This project focuses on analysing employee performance and retention patterns within an organisation. The project encompasses all critical stages of data analysis, from data preparation and modeling to insight generation, visualization, and reporting using Python.



## 📌 Project Overview
The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee productivity, performance, and retention, and provide actionable insights for improving workforce efficiency, reducing turnover, and fostering a positive work environment.

Deliverables

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Perform a thorough EDA to explore key trends and outliers. Generate descriptive statistics and visualisations to understand patterns in employee performance, retention, and demographics. 
2. Data Preprocessing : Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring consistency in data formatting.
 3. Key Metrics Analysis : Analyse key performance and retention metrics such as length of service , average training score , awards won , previous year ratings , and KPIs met .
 4. Retention Trends Analysis : Assess retention trends based on age , education , department , and training .
 5. Predictive Insights : Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations to HR for improving employee retention and performance management strategies. 
6. Final Report : A detailed report documenting all steps of the analysis, findings, insights, and recommendations. This will include visualisations to support the conclusion
